About this dataset:
The Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date.This database contains 14 attributes.
The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. 
The integer value 0 = no/less chance of heart attack and 1 = more chance of heart attack.

Attribute Information: 
1) Age : Age of the patient

2) Sex : Sex of the patient

3) cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type
Value 1: typical angina
Value 2: atypical angina
Value 3: non-anginal pain
Value 4: asymptomatic

4) trestbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

5) chol : cholesterol in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

6) fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

7) restecg : resting electrocardiographic results
Value 0: normal
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

8) thalach : maximum heart rate achieved

9) exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

10) oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

11) slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Value 1: upsloping
Value 2: flat
Value 3: downsloping

12) ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flouroscopy

13) thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

14) target: 0= no/less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
